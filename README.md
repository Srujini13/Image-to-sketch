**Image to Sketch Project**


**Overview**

The Image to Sketch project is a Python-based application that converts images into artistic sketches.
Using image processing techniques, this tool utilizes OpenCV and other libraries to apply various transformations and filters, resulting in a stylized pencil sketch effect.

**Features**

Convert images to sketches with high accuracy
Simple and intuitive command-line interface

**Requirements**

To run this project, you'll need to have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing images)


You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/srujini13/image-to-sketch.git

cd image-to-sketch

Install the required packages (as mentioned above).

Usage
To convert an image to a sketch, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python imagetosketch.py image.jpg sketch.jpg
image.jpg: Path to the input image you want to convert.
sketch.jpg: Path where the output sketch will be saved.
